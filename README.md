Hi, I'm Lucie 

I'm a developer who enjoys continuous learning.

Right now, I work mostly with ServiceNow, where I use JavaScript to customize features daily.
Outside of work, I spend time building an absence management app for a kindergarten lately.
I've also done an extensive course to learn React to be able to use it for future front-end development.
Being able to see a project built from the first draft on paper to deployment brings me real joy.
